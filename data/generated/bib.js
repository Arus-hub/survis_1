        "abstract": "The term \u201cfraud\u201d, it always concerned about credit card fraud in our minds. And after the significant increase in the transactions of credit card, the fraud of credit card increased extremely in last years. So the fraud detection should include surveillance of the spending attitude for the person/customer to the determination, avoidance, and detection of unwanted behavior. Because the credit card is the most payment predominant way for the online and regular purchasing, the credit card fraud raises highly. The Fraud detection is not only concerned with capturing of the fraudulent practices, but also, discover it as fast as they can, because the fraud costs millions of dollar business loss and it is rising over time, and that affects greatly the worldwide economy. In this paper we introduce 14 different techniques of how data mining techniques can be successfully combined to obtain a high fraud coverage with a high or low false rate, the Advantage and The Disadvantages of every technique, and The Data Sets used in the researches by researchers.",

        "abstract": "As credit card becomes the most popular payment mode particularly in the online sector, the fraudulent activities using credit card payment technologies are rapidly increasing as a result. For this end, it is obligatory for financial institutions to continuously improve their fraud detection systems to reduce huge losses. The purpose of this paper is to develop a novel system for credit card fraud detection based on sequential modeling of data, using attention mechanism and LSTM deep recurrent neural networks. The proposed model, compared to previous studies, considers the sequential nature of transactional data and allows the classifier to identify the most important transactions in the input sequence that predict at higher accuracy fraudulent transactions. Precisely, the robustness of our model is built by combining the strength of three sub-methods; the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) for selecting the most useful predictive features, the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks for incorporating transaction sequences and the attention mechanism to enhance LSTM performances. The experimentations of our model give strong results in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.",

        "abstract": "The negative effect of financial crimes on financial institutions has grown dramatically over the years. To detect crimes such as credit card fraud, several single and hybrid machine learning approaches have been used. However, these approaches have significant limitations as no further investigation on different hybrid algorithms for a given dataset were studied. This research proposes and investigates seven hybrid machine learning models to detect fraudulent activities with a real word dataset. The developed hybrid models consisted of two phases, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms were used first to detect credit card fraud, then, hybrid methods were constructed based on the best single algorithm from the first phase. Our findings indicated that the hybrid model Adaboost + LGBM is the champion model as it displayed the highest performance. Future studies should focus on studying different types of hybridization and algorithms in the credit card domain.",

        "abstract": "The escalating usage levels of credit cards has resulted in the generation of enormous amounts of data, which in-turn has resulted in huge amounts of fraudulent activities in this domain. The major issues in fraud detection on credit card transaction data is that they are huge and they exhibit huge imbalance levels. This paper presents a multi-level ensemble model called Bagging Multiple Boosted Trees (BMBT) for credit card fraud detection by bagging multiple boosted trees. Bagging is performed by creating overlapping subsets of the training data. Each base learner of the bagged model is composed of boosted trees, enabling effective predictions by effectively handling data imbalance. Voting based prediction aggregation provides the final predictions. Experiments were conducted with UCSD-FICO data and comparisons with the existing models in literature indicates that the proposed BMBT model outperforms the existing models at the rate of 1-5 percent in terms of AUC, BCR, BER and TNR levels.",

One the most common financial services is the credit cards, where the customers can complete any financial payments using a credit card, such as; Visa card and MasterCard. However, criminals started to find ways to attack customers' cards for fraud purposes, and that has caused a big issue for both of companies and customers.

With credit cards becoming the most popular payment method for both offline and online transactions, the number of cases of fraud associated with them is rapidly increasing. In case of online fraud, it is not necessary for the perpetrators to be present at the scene of crime. The fraudulent activities can be accomplished by them in the seclusion of their homes through a multitude of methods for disguising their identities. VPNs are one way to obscure one's identity, as is routing communication through any Tor network for the victim, making it difficult to track back the culprit.",

        "abstract": "Today illegal activities regarding online financial transactions have become increasingly complex and borderless, resulting in huge financial losses for both sides, customers and organizations. Many techniques have been proposed to fraud prevention and detection in the online environment. However, all of these techniques besides having the same goal of identifying and combating fraudulent online transactions, they come with their own characteristics, advantages and disadvantages. In this context, this paper reviews the existing research done in fraud detection with the aim of identifying algorithms used and analyze each of these algorithms based on certain criteria. To analyze the research studies in the field of fraud detection, the systematic quantitative literature review methodology was applied. Based on the most called machinelearning algorithms in scientific articles and their characteristics, a hierarchical typology is made. Therefore, our paper highlights, in a new way, the most suitable techniques for detecting fraud by combining three selection criteria: accuracy, coverage and costs",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has limited people&rsquo;s mobility to a certain extent, making it difficult to purchase goods and services offline, which has led the creation of a culture of increased dependence on online services. One of the crucial issues with using credit cards is fraud, which is a serious challenge in the realm of online transactions. Consequently, there is a huge need to develop the best approach possible to using machine learning in order to prevent almost all fraudulent credit card transactions. This paper studies a total of 66 machine learning models based on two stages of evaluation. A real-world credit card fraud detection dataset of European cardholders is used in each model along with stratified K-fold cross-validation. In the first stage, nine machine learning algorithms are tested to detect fraudulent transactions. The best three algorithms are nominated to be used again in the second stage, with 19 resampling techniques used with each one of the best three algorithms. Out of 330 evaluation metric values that took nearly one month to obtain, the All K-Nearest Neighbors (AllKNN) undersampling technique along with CatBoost (AllKNN-CatBoost) is considered to be the best proposed model. Accordingly, the AllKNN-CatBoost model is compared with related works. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms previous models with an AUC value of 97.94, a Recall value of 95.91, and an F1-Score value of 87.40.",
